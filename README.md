# Code-Sample
This was requested as a challenge.
Code represents a live-updating tree view as a web application.
I had to utilize socket.io as updates to the factories needed to display across browsers.
The project also required excellent error handling and protection against sql injection.
I terminated my old Amazon account and so the web link no longer works for this, but hopefully you will be able to follow and view the comments within 
for understanding.
I used SQL for the database querying.
