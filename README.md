# Code-Sample
I was requested to build this out as a challenge for a software position.
They requested a live-updating tree view as a web application.
I had to utilize socket.io as they wanted any updates to the factories to display across browsers.
The project also required excellent error handling and protection against sql injection.
I terminated my old Amazon account and so the web link no longer works for this, but hopefully you will be able to follow and view the comments within 
for understanding.
I used SQL for the database querying.
